# Cornerstone web tech test

## Overview

Create a Web app that utilises the NASA Open API for browsing the Astronomy Picture of the Day.

We use React at Cornerstone and would prefer the test to be completed with this library. 
So, if you want to use a framework/library, we require React, otherwise, please use plain vanilla JS, with some helper libraries (if required).

Please spend up to around 2 hours on this task.

## Requirements

- If you've chosen React, use [create-react-app][rca] for the project base and [react-router-dom][rrd] for routing

- App should be able to run on the latest version of [Node.js][node] with only the following commands

  ```sh
  npm install
  npm start
  ```

- Homepage should show Astronomy Picture of the Day for current day

- Navigating to `/YYYY-MM-DD` should show Astronomy Picture of the Day for YYYY-MM-DD

- Homepage should have a date picker for easily navigating to `/YYYY-MM-DD`

- App should make use of the latest JavaScript features such as;
  - `import` + `export` in place of `require()` + `module.exports`
  - arrow functions where they reduce the complexity of the code or lexical scope
  - `rest` and `spread` properties
  - object destructuring
  - anything else you find nifty

## NASA Open API

Once you have your [API key][api_key] you should be able to access the data required using the following endpoint

**HTTP Request**

GET https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod

**Query Parameters**

| Parameter | Type       | Default  | Description                                    |
| --------- | ---------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| date      | YYYY-MM-DD | today    | The date of the APOD image to retrieve         |
| hd        | bool       | False    | Retrieve the URL for the high resolution image |
| api_key   | string     | DEMO_KEY | api.nasa.gov key for expanded usage            |

**Example Query**

GET https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=DEMO_KEY

## Bonus Task

- Unit tests
- If you've chosen vanilla JS, use whatever you feel is right for state management.
- If you've chosen React, use [React component state][react_state] or [Redux][redux] to store/cache data fetched from the API to avoid hitting the server again for repeat requests
- If you've chosen React, style the app using [styled components][styled_components]
